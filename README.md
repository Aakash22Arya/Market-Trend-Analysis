**Invest in your dreams by leveraging deep learning for smarter trading decisions.**  

## Stateful LSTM  

We implemented **Multistep Time Series Prediction** using **Stateful LSTMs**, which utilize the batching property of LSTMs to retain memory across sequences. Our model learns from various financial parameters, analyzed through rigorous data exploration and fine-tuned hyperparameters.  

For this project, we used **Dow Jones Top 30 Stocks** as the primary dataset.

## Key Features of Our Trading Algorithms  

Our model integrates multiple financial heuristics to enhance stock predictions and risk assessments:  

- **Mutual Funds Analysis** – Evaluates fund performance and investment strategies.  
- **Prediction Analysis** – Uses deep learning to forecast stock price trends.  
- **Portfolio Risk Assessment** – Analyzes volatility and risk factors in investment portfolios.  
- **News Sentiment Analysis** – Extracts and interprets market sentiment from financial news.
